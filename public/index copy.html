<h1>The Best Movies According to Gautham</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Fight CLub</h3>
<p>mind blowing</p>
<h3>all the bright places</h3>
<p>One of the most beautiful movies I have ever watched. The actors did such an amazing job bringing out the characters. (SPOILER WARNING) The ending was heartbreaking but it was portrayed in such a beautiful way</p>
<h3>Beautiful Boy</h3>
<p>It hit close to home and addressed many thing i have previously been through, just not quite as serious and gave me the honest perspective from both sides</p>
